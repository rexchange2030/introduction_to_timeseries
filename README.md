# Let's Keep It Short And Simple
# Introduction To Time Series And Prediction

# I. Time Series Introduction (Trend, Seasonality, and noise) -
In this colab,
1. You will be introduced about the time series 
2. You will known what "trend" looks like in time series (Trend - It is generally the upward or downward observation)
3. You will be introduced with "Seasonality" in time series (Seasonality - It is the occurence of events after a certain period of time.)
4. You will know that sometimes how "Noise" can be a problem (or necessary sometimes) and what it looks like (Noise - Unwanted interruptions, unpredictable events)
5. At last, how to combine trend, seasonality and noise to create a simple time series.

# II. Time Windows Dataset Creation
In this Colab, 
1. You will be introduced to time windows
2. It simply means creating the dataset to feed to the architecture for the predictions.
3. You will know how to create dataset with simple data given and how to split them in training and testing/validation sets.

# III. Moving Average for improving Time Series Forecasting
In this colab, 
1. You will be introduced to Moving Average (process of removing noise from time series so as to improve prediction.
2. Metric to measure the performance of Time Series Forecasting (generally, Mean Absolute Error(MAE) is used. As it is an error metric so less is better)
3. Also know about how to use "differencing" in time series so as to improve time series predictions (or lowering MAE)
